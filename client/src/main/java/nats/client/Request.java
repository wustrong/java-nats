/**
 * Holds the attributes associated with a request.
 *
 * <p>This interface is similar to {@link Subscription}. However, it has some important differences. Instances of
 * {@code Subscription} are {@link Iterable}; requests are not. A request cannot be iterable. If a reply to the request
 * is received before the {@link Iterable#iterator()} method is invoked, the reply will get lost. If the replies are
 * queued and {@link Iterable#iterator()} is never invoked, memory will be wasted.
 *
 * <p>Additionally, {@code Subscription} has a {@link Subscription#addMessageHandler(MessageHandler)} method for adding
 * {@link MessageHandler}s after the subscription has been created. Similar to the previous problem, if a reply is
 * received before the {@code MessageHandler} has been added to the request, receipt of the message will be lost.
